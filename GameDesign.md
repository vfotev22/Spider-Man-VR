## Main Goal:
The player’s main objective is to complete Spider-Man’s day of crime-fighting. This is done by fighting and defeating all enemies. As well as getting all the photographs done for Spider-Man’s job.

## Main Character:
The player will control Spider-Man. A superhero with Spider powers. His powers include super strength, the ability to crawl on walls, and allow him to shoot webs from his wrists that allow him jim to traverse New York City. Spider-Man is a lighthearted character who is always optimistic in life and always cracking jokes while fighting villains.

## World/Environment:
The game will be set in New York City. This environment is great for our main character because it allows him to traverse by swinging on his webs. We are going for a comic book look and feel for our city, main character, and enemies.
